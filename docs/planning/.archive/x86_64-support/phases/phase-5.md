## Finalization Tasks

### 1. Documentation

- [ ] Create `docs/HARDWARE_SUPPORT.md` listing NUC compatibility.
- [ ] Update `BOOT_SPECIFICATION.md` to include Multiboot2 details.

### 2. Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove any remaining AArch64 assumptions in generic modules.
- [ ] Ensure all TODO(TEAM_251) are addressed or tracked.
- [ ] Perform a "No Dead Code" sweep (Rule 6).

### 3. Handoff
- [ ] Finalize `TEAM_251_x86_64_support_audit.md` with implementation results.
- [ ] Record a demo video or log of x86_64 booting on a NUC (if possible).
- [ ] Create a "future work" list (e.g., NVMe, USB, Graphics).
