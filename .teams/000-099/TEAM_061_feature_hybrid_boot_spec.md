# TEAM_061: Feature - Hybrid Boot Specification

## Goal
Formalize and implement the Hybrid Boot Specification for LevitateOS, aligning with industry standards (UEFI, Linux) and the Pixel 6 (GS101) hardware target.

## Status
- [ ] Phase 1: Discovery (GS101 & Industry Alignment)
- [ ] Phase 2: Design (State Machine & API)
- [ ] Phase 3: Implementation (Refactor kmain)
- [ ] Phase 4: Integration & Verification (QEMU & Pixel 6 readiness)
- [ ] Phase 5: Polish & Handoff

## Handoff Notes
- Inherited work from TEAM_060 (Blinking cursor, basic stages).
- Goal is to establish a rigorous, standardized boot flow that bridges QEMU and Pixel 6.
