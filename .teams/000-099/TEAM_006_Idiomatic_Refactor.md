# Team Log - TEAM_006

**Summary**: Refactoring the kernel for Rust idiomaticity, specifically focusing on the allocator and synchronization.

## Activities
- [x] Initialized team log
- [x] Research idiomatic allocator patterns in `no_std`
- [x] Refactor allocator to use `LockedHeap` or equivalent
- [x] Review other "C-like" patterns (e.g., GIC init, global variables)

## Notes
- Team ID: TEAM_006
- Objective: Reduce "C emulation" and embrace Rust idioms.
