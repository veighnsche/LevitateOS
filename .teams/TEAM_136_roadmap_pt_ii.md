# Team 136: Roadmap Part II & Userspace Expansion

**Start Date:** 2026-01-05
**Objective:** Define and plan "Roadmap Part II", focusing on expanding the userspace ecosystem with standard libraries and applications.

## Plan
1. Analyze current userspace capabilities.
2. Define "Phase 10" (or Part II) of the roadmap.
3. Update `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
4. (Optional) Begin scaffolding `ulib` or `levbox`.

## Decisions
- Focus on POSIX-like basics first (`ls`, `cat`, `ps`).
- Expand `libsyscall` towards a richer `ulib` to support these apps.
