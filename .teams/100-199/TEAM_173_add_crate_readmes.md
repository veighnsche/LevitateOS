# Team Log - TEAM_173

## Objective
Find all Rust crates in the repository and add a `README.md` to each one.

## Progress
- [x] Identify all crates
- [x] Develop implementation plan
- [x] Create READMEs for identified crates

## Conclusion
All Rust crates in the repository now have a `README.md` file. Parent directories (`README.md` and `userspace/README.md`) have been updated to link to these new documents. Additionally, minor compilation errors in the `ulib` crate were fixed to ensure the workspace builds cleanly.

## Context
This task aims to improve documentation and discoverability for the various components of LevitateOS.
